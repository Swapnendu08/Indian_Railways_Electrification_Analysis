# Indian_Railways_Electrification_Analysis
The predictive Analysis Report of Electrification is based on the Monte Carlo Simulation (Predictive ML Algorithm) which predicts the rate of electrification done by Indian Government and the direction(+ve/-ve)
of the graph.

The Triamgular Distribution technique is used in the model to generate the random variables and done the simulation 100 times to get accurate result.

For the plots generated,If the Regression/TrendLine slope is greater than 1,Then we can say that in futute,INDIAN GOVERNMENT will perform electrification fast as given in the present Dataset.
Otherwise,the rate of Electrification will be slow as max amount of electrification is done in the past.
